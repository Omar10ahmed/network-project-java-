# network-project-java-
a basic network project contains server and client 

This project combines two key functionalities: a web-based CV display and a real-time client-server chat application. Built using Java and HTML, it demonstrates the integration of networking concepts with file handling and web technologies. The application is divided into two main components:

Features
1. Student CV Display
Displays a detailed student CV, including:
Name, education, skills, and experience.
The CV is stored as an HTML file and served by the server.
Clients can request and view the CV from the server.
2. Client-Server Chat Application
Real-time text-based chat application enabling communication between multiple clients via a central server.
Features include:
Server-side message broadcasting to all connected clients.
Concurrent client handling using multithreading.
Project Structure
Server:
Hosts the CV file (student_cv.html) and manages communication between multiple clients.
Handles client requests to serve the CV or relay chat messages.
Client:
Connects to the server to retrieve and display the CV.
Enables users to participate in real-time chat with other clients.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for both server and client-side implementations.
Socket Programming: Enables real-time communication between the server and clients.
HTML: Displays the student CV in a structured and visually appealing format.
File I/O: Used for server-side file handling to manage and serve the CV.
How It Works
Server:
Starts and listens for incoming client connections on a specified port.
Sends the HTML CV file upon request.
Relays chat messages between connected clients.
Client:
Connects to the server using its IP address and port.
Requests and displays the CV in the console or a browser.
Sends and receives chat messages to/from other clients via the server.

Setup and Usage


Future Enhancements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for the chat application.
Implement user authentication for secure communication.
Extend CV functionality to support file uploads and dynamic updates.
Add support for additional media in the CV, such as images or downloadable resumes.
